# Conversation Platform 4 Marketing (CP4M)

CP4M is a conversational marketing platform which enables advertisers to integrate their customer-facing chatbots with
FB Messenger/WhatsApp, in order to meet customers where they are and drive native conversations on the advertiser's
owned infra.

# Details

CP4M acts as a bridge between existing Messenger and Whatsapp APIs and existing LLM APIs (OpenAI, LLaMa, etc.)

## Quickstart

### 1 Configuration file

Almost all of CP4M's configurations are set via a configuration file. This file can be in either JSON or TOML format, we
use TOML here for brevity.

#### 1.1 create a file to hold the configuration

```bash
$ mkdir /tmp/cp4m
$ touch /tmp/cp4m/cp4m.toml
```

#### 1.2 copy one of the texts below into your newly created TOML file

##### Example: Whatsapp & OpenAI

```toml
port = 8080

[[plugins]]
name = "openai_test"
type = "openai"
model = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
api_key = "<your api key here>"

[[stores]]
name = "memory_test"
type = "memory"
storage_duration_hours = 1
storage_capacity_mbs = 1

[[handlers]]
type = "whatsapp"
name = "whatsapp_test"
verify_token = "<your verification token here>"
app_secret = "<your verification app secret here>"
access_token = "<you access token here>"

[[services]]
webhook_path = "/whatsapp"
plugin = "openai_test"
store = "memory_test"
handler = "whatsapp_test"
```

##### Example: WhatsApp & Llama 2 (via AWS Bedrock)
